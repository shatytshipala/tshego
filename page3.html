Media’s role and influence on society <br> <br>
The media persistently continues to portray the world however way they choose. The media makes use of the SEARCH acronym to scrutinize any form of media. The SEARCH acronym which represents Sex, Environment, Age, Race and Religion and Handicapped can be used a way to decide how media mark an individual based on their social diversities. It is evident that through SEARCH we can examine any form of media to discover who the target audience appears to be. In this essay the student will do perform a SEARCH analysis on the Old Guard film poster. The student will then link this up by discussing the role of media and how it influences the society. <br> <br>

This film poster is eye-catching to the viewer, the image of Charlize Theron who plays the role of Andy is centered in the poster. Their bodies are made to appear as powerful and fearless. The wording or title of the advert stipulates that main character might be older however, her image in the poster portrays her as young. This could mean that she might be young looking but she has a mind of an older person meaning she is a sharp and quick thinker. The viewer that might also be female, it gives them a sense of believing that the can do anything they set the mind to. As all the characters on the poster are celebrities, this can be seen as an effective way which is used to gain the attention of the audience. Since the character here have fans which are both male and female this will attract a larger audience for the film. <br> <br>
Environment: the movie 
Age: since the movie has scenes where there is bullet ridden bodies and the characters rising up fully healed after being slaughtered and them also spitting out the bullets which have penetrated into their faces, this film will not be suitable for the younger generation. However, this poster appeals more to the more matured audiences who love watching science fiction film, this due to the fact that matured or middle-aged audiences are being able and the most productive in society. <br> <br>
Race and religion: there is no limit on the film post which relates to the race and religion of the character or that of the audience. The characters in the poster are white and black American, which indicates that there is no discrimination among them. <br> <br>

The media’s role in influencing and reflecting society
According to Macmillian Dictionary (2019) the term media refers to “any form of communication that delivers information and communicates with a larger audience as possible all at once. Society looks to the media for information on social, political, international and local news flow as well as popular culture. Dictionary.com (2021) proposes that a society is a group of people who have banded together for religious, political, cultural or other reasons. <br> <br>
Neale (2014) puts forward that nowadays the media has a huge impact on how individuals behave, whether the information we get is accurate, incorrect, rumor or speculation, it can be transmitted with a few mouse clicks and this can have an impact on interpersonal relations. The has the ability to manage, convince, influence and even control society in both positive or negative ways. It can also be emotionally, physically and also psychologically. With the media having the ability to control society this means that society is meant to consider everything the media tells them to do and not even question it. <br> <br>
Neale (2014) further asserts that in today’s world, the media is everywhere and can quickly reach to areas in the form of breaking news, it can be internationally or locally. It is evident that the media has the ability to shape how people are perceived, which means that peoples careers can shift in an instant. Individuals who are in the spotlight can also be manipulated by the media to live their lives in a certain way or to rebel against what the “should” be like. <br> <br> 
Murtza (2019) suggest that the media has some positive aspects to it such as it brings awareness among mass people, it mirror society, it connects people of all over the globe, it is a hub of information and it helps people know about the latest happenings. With the advancement of technology, print media has expanded to include television, film, the internet and radio, media has become as important as our daily requirement in today’s world. Today’s media has a critical role in forming and shaping public opinion as well as building society. The goal of democracy is to use the media as a sword, this means that the media is required to serve as a watchdog to defend the interests of the people and to also raise public knowledge about any wrongdoing. It is also evident that in the fight against injustice, wrongdoing or oppression in the society the media is required play a critical role. <br> <br>
To sum up everything that has been said this far, it is apparent that the media plays a crucial role in communication. In order for the public to interact with each other the media has to embrace all forms of communication.
