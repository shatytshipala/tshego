The role of semiotics in advertising<br> <br>
The spreading of any organization’s product or services can easily be done through advertising. Advertising can portray an organization’s products correctly or completely distort its image. It is therefore, important to organizations to make sure that the messages they are trying to communicate are not ambiguous in any form. In this essay the student will discuss what advertising is, the student will provide a discussion semiotics and how they are used in advertising. To sum up everything the student will do a semiotic analysis on the Colgate advertisement. <br> <br>
 According to Ward (2018) adverting can be defined as “the attempt to influence the buying behavior of customers or clients with a persuasive selling message about products or a service”. It is evident that advertising performs certain roles in the media such as it helps spread awareness, people are alerted about new products and services in the market that possibly fulfils their needs or solves their problem. Through advertising LaMarco (2019) suggests that through consistent republishing of the brands products and services to the audience the media popularizes the brand. <br> <br>
However, with the use of adverts, it is very crucial that organizations are able to interpret their messages as intended, this therefore leads to the concept of semiotics. Dawson (2020) indicates that semiotics is the study of how we interpret meaning from the environment around us through signs and symbols. This concept was made known by Swiss linguist Ferdinarde Saussure in the 20th century. It is apparent that his work aids in explaining the reason why we attach certain meanings to certain objects. <br> <br>
In every advert there is a denotation or connotation linked to it. Merriam Webster Dictionary suggest that a direct specific meaning as distinct from an implied or associated idea is known as denotation. The denotation in the advertisement is that it shows that Colgate is the best product for oral hygiene, with products such as toothpastes, toothbrushes, mouthwashes and dental floss. According to MasterClass Staff (2021) connotation is the use of a word to propose a different association than the literal meaning. Due to the face that we are currently facing the Covid-19 pandemic and we are required to always wear a face mask, this means that we are not able to see each other’s smile. The connotation evident here is that even though we are wearing masks we don’t need to see the smiles but to rather feel them but our smiles are not just a facial expression but rather as a form of tool which helps us overcome the challenges we face daily. <br> <br>
The advert is in black and white, the use of this two neutral colors has the ability to get the audience to focus on the basics of the advert. With Colgate using these colors they have made their oral hygiene product the central point. The colorless advert draws more attention to the key features present rather than encouraging distraction with the use of bright colors. With this ad being colorless the audience is most likely to concentrate on what is presented and ultimately watching the advert with more attention to detail.  
The text which says that “smiles always find a way” is an example of a signifier, Dawson (2020) notes that a “sign’s physical form such as a sound, printed word or image) as distinct from its meaning”. The texts here indicate that regardless of what we might face we are able to still smile through it. <br> <br>
The visual elements in the Colgate logo. It being present there is a way to strengthen their brand exposure and assists the audience to associate with the product on a deeper level. This also boosts the company’s corporate identity and the more visible the logo appears on their advertisements, the more trust the company will gain from the audience and this will therefore lead to greater sale, profits and revenues. <br> <br>
The second visual element on the advert is the tagline which say smiles always finds a way. The use of this words point towards the benefits of the product. The use of these words are used to highlight image of the company and to make it memorable for the audience.  The use of this tagline or slogan is to tell the audience about what the product is about, what it does and how the audience can benefit from it. <br> <br>
Finally, the last element is the two characters who seem to be smiling at each other. This conveys a message that the two have some sort of relationship, either being platonic or romantic. Even though the images in their background is a bit blurry, there seems to cars and what looks like a building. This the reason for it being blurry is to make sure that the advert only draws attention to the two main characters.
