the representation of athlete by the media<br> <br>
It is pretty clear we live in a society that is mostly dominated by men, this evident in sports. Men receive tremendous media attention as compared to women. Men are expected and portrayed to be strong, capable and powerful individuals who can compete in anything. However, when a woman portrays such strength as with the case of Caster Semenya it is viewed as something which is bizarre and should be banned. In this essay the student will discuss the gender positions and identities of men and woman in sports. The student make reference to the LUX advert as part of the discussion. <br> <br>
According to O’ Shaughnessy, Standler and Casey (2016:198) culture jamming is a type of media activism in which existing media texts are subverted and reworked, or significant corporations, public persons and their media images are parodied. <br> <br>
Ciallan (2016) indicates that in sports, the issue of fairness is typically straightforward, when an athlete gains an unfair advantage through unethical tactics, the integrity of the sports and competitions can be tainted. However, some of the athlete’s physical attributes can be seen as gifts when being compared to others. For instance, the quality of a basketball player is not simply decided by how tall he is. <br> <br>
Ciallan (2016) puts forward that in sporting aspects such as lung capacity, wingspan, height and other things all play a role in separating the good from the exceptional. We cannot however categorize athletes solely on these recommendations. It is due to this reason that males and females are not allowed to compete against one another, due to the fact that it would be appropriate to expect woman to compete with men because they are physically stronger and faster. <br> <br>
However, South African Olympic Athlete Caster Semenya faces discrimination for her physical attributes. In the LUX advert begins with the narrator saying that identify as a woman does not make you one and that there is nothing feminine about her. This id due to the fact that she has a higher level of testosterone unlike a normal female. The advert shows her running away from what appears to be like a shadow, this makes reference to the IAA.  LUX centers this ad on an emotive perspective that features the athlete herself. <br> <br>
It is noticeable that the message that LUX aims to convey with this advertisement is to indicate that woman should not be judged based on how they look or be exposed due to what makes them who they are.
